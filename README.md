Hi, I’m Abel Mekonen, a 19-year-old Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa Science and Technology University in Ethiopia. My coding journey began in 2021 during 10th grade, sparking my passion for web, app, and game development, as well as AI and Machine Learning.

I’m skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web design and continuously improving in Python, Data Structures, and Algorithms. I hold certifications in Problem Solving, Python, CSS, and Programming Fundamentals, and I’m always eager to expand my knowledge.

I completed a Web Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech, where I gained valuable hands-on experience and refined my skills. I also enjoy tackling coding challenges on LeetCode and HackerRank and contributing to projects on GitHub.
