Hi, my name is Abel Mekonen, and I’m a 19-year-old software enthusiast from Ethiopia. I was born and raised here, and I’m still living in this beautiful country while pursuing my passion for technology and development. I completed my education at Cruise School, where I studied from nursery all the way through high school. Now, I’m studying Software Engineering at Addis Ababa Science and Technology University, a journey that has allowed me to dive deeper into the world of programming and development.

My love for coding started back in 2021 when I was in 10th grade. Since then, I’ve been on a continuous journey of self-improvement, teaching myself how to code and expanding my knowledge through online courses. I’ve earned a few certificates in areas like Problem Solving, Python, CSS, and Programming Fundamentals, but I’m always striving to learn more. My interest lies in web, app, and game development, as well as the emerging fields of AI and Machine Learning. Although I’m currently most comfortable with designing websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’m actively working on improving my skills, particularly in Python and Data Structures and Algorithms.

Right now, I’m interning at Prodigy InfoTech as a Web Development Intern, where I’m gaining valuable real-world experience in web development. This opportunity is helping me refine my skills and build a foundation for my future career in tech. Every day is a new chance to improve, whether it’s diving into a coding challenge on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank, or contributing to my projects on GitHub.
